# loulouTrainer

GUI application to train Loulou, a simple neural network built for MNIST database.
Created for educational and tests reasons, but feel free to adapt it however you want.

* Version 0.0.1 : Only a basic electron application.

* Version 0.0.2 : Form to choose options for training added.
	Layers selection needs to be fully rewrote.
